## Project Prerequisites

- Visual Studio 2022 or JetBrains Rider is preferred, however any modern .NET IDE can also be used.
- Docker is required to run the integration tests locally.

## Change Guidelines

- Ensure you follow the style guidelines of this project when writing code.
- Ensure unit tests are written or updated for the feature, bugfix or hotfix.
- Add code comments if necessary to hard-to-understand code.
- Add documentation comments to new public APIs created.
- Document new features in project `ReadMe` if necessary.

## Pull requests

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a branch from `develop` to work with and use `feature/`, `bugfix/` or `hotfix/` as a prefix.
3. Implement change
4. Once done, rebase from `develop` and create a pull request to merge into `develop`.

### Tests

To run the tests, you can run them via your IDE test explorer or via the .NET CLI.

**Note**: If you don't have Docker installed, the integration tests will fail as we use [TestContainers](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-dotnet) to run them. You can either not run them or install Docker to run them locally.

## For Maintainers

**Git Flow**

- New features, enhancements and bug fixes should be branched off from `develop` branch.
- `hotfix` branches should be branched off from `main` branch.
- All pull request(s) into `develop` branch should be completed with a `squash merge`.
- Only `release/*` or a `hotfix/*` branch should be merged (`merge commit`) into `main`
- Once `develop` has reached a release milestone, create a `release` branch from `develop`, setup a pull request, and then merge (`merge commit`) into `main`. Finally delete `release` branch.
- Once a stable release has been published, `main` should be merged (`merge commit`) into `develop`.
